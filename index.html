    <h1>Gyomei Himejima</h1>
    <p><strong>Gyomei Himejima</strong> is considered to be the strongest Demon Slayer amongst the Demon Slayer Corps. He is believed to be able to take on more than one Upper Rank Demon at once all by himself. This is proven to be true when he fought against Kokushibo during the Infinity Castle Arc.</p>
